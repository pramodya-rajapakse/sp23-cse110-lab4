1. The program will print 3.
2. The program will print 150.
3. The program will print 150.
4. It will return the array '[50, 100, 150]'.
5. There will be an error because the variable 'i' was not declared outside of the for-loop.
6. There will be an error because the variable 'discountedPrice' was not declared outside of the for-loop.
7. The program will print 150.
8. The program will return the array '[50, 100, 150]'.
9. There will be an error because the variable 'i' was not declared outside of the for-loop.
10. The program will print 3.
11. The function will return '[50, 100, 150]'.
12. A. student.name, B. user['Grad Year'], C. student.greeting(), D. student['Favorite Teacher'].name, E. student.courseLoad[0]
13. 
    1.  A. '32', since the 2 is converted to its string representation and concatenated to the string '3'
    2.  B. 1, since the '3' is converted to its integer representation, and then subtracts 2
    3.  C. 3, since the null becomes 0 and is added to the integer 3
    4.  D. '3null', since the null acts as a string and is concatenated to the string '3'
    5.  E. 4, since the value of true maps to the integer 1
    6.  F. 0, since the value of false maps to the integer 0, and the value of null becomes the integer 0, which sums to 0
    7.  G. '3undefined', since undefined becomes itself as a string which is concatented to the string '3'
    8.  H. NaN, since '3' becomes its integer representation and tries to subtract the integer value of undefined which is NaN
14. 
    1. A. true, since the integer representation of '2' is 2 which is greater than the integer 1
    2. B. false, since the string '2' is greater than the string '12' (since it starts with a high char value)
    3. C. true, since the string '2' becomes its integer value 2
    4. D. false, since '2' is string and 2 is an integer (different types)
    5. E. false, since true maps to the integer value 1 which is not equal to the integer 2
    6. F. true, since Boolean(2) will be true (since its not 0), which is the same type and value as true
 15. The '==' will perform type operations on the given values to make them the same type to compare. The '===' operator will check if the values are the same type and the same value, without doing type conversion.
 17. The result will be the array '[2,4,6]'. newArr starts an empty array. Then, for each value in array which is [1,2,3], the function calls the function passed in callback, which is 'doSomething()'. Do something will take the value each each index and return its value multiplied by 2, which is then pushed into newArr. So modifyArray will return the given array with all values multiplied by 2.
